# Chapter 1: Is Docker Right For You?

## 1.1. Docker's biggest wins
-----------------------------

- Saving time and money.
- VMs waste lots of resources (like Vagrant).
- Each Vagrantbox is huge, around 700mb-1GB. So we need lots of spaces for each project.
- Docker is 10x efficient than Vagrant when it comes to disk space.
- Prevents 'it works on my machine' issues.
- Prevents problems like dependency version mismatch.
- Docker runs your apps in a controlled environment.
- Keeps your system nice and clean.
- Prevents setup burden of languages and tools.

## 1.2. Why I got started with Docker?
--------------------------------------

- VMs create isolated environments, but they are slow and not efficient.
- Then LXC came into the action. The problem with LXCs is, they are tough to use, because they are complicated.
