# Chapter 4: Installing Docker

## 4.1. Docker Community Edition vs. Docker EE
----------------------------------------------

- Docker CE is production ready. Docker EE is for mission critical apps.

- Docker EE provides:

  - Certified images and plugins
  - Vulnerability scans
  - Access to Docker datacenter
  - Official support

- Prices range 750$ to 2000$ per year.

- Docker CE edition comes with two release channels:

  - Edge channel: Released each month. Getting updates at the same month.
  - Stable channel: Released every 4 months. Each release is supported for 4 months.

- Docker EE releases are every 3 months. Each release is supported for 12 months.

- Versioning scheme is structured with date. For example `17.03` means 2017 March.

## 4.2. Docker toolbox vs. Docker for Mac/Windows
-------------------------------------------------

Docker toolbox installs:
  - Docker CE/EE
  - Docker Compose
  - Docker Machine
  - VirtualBox
  - Docker QuickStart Terminal
  - Kitematic

Since the `docker-daemon` requires Linux, and OSx and Windows are not running Linux you need some way to load up Linux in OSx and Windows. Here VirtualBox comes into the action. Remember, VirtualBox is a type-2 hypervisor. `docker machine` helps you create servers and install docker. It's a command line tool. Docker machine can be used locally in cloud.

- Docker for Mac/Windows is a newer tool than Docker toolbox, and is the prefered way. No VirtualBox is required for Docker for Mac/Windows because it uses the type-1 hypervisor (OSx: Hyper-Kit, Windows: Hyper-V).

Docker for Mac/Windows installs:
  - Docker CE/EE
  - Docker Compose
  - Docker Machine

**Docker Toolbox vs. Docker for Mac/Windows**

- Docker Toolbox (with type2 hypervisor, virtualbox):
  - Requires Windows 7+ or Mountain Lion 10.8+, and Windows home version is ok.
  - Works on older hardware
  - Docker daemon is running on remote. Ie: access 192.168.99.100 etc.
  - You have to use `docker quick start terminal`.

- Docker for Mac/Windows (with type1 hypervisor, natively, without VirtualBox):
  - Requires Win 10 (Pro, Ent, Stu) or Yosemite 10.10.3+
  - Requires hardware never than 2010
  - Docker daemon is running locally. Ie. access localhost
  - You can use any terminal you want.

## 4.3. Verifying you have Docker installed
-------------------------------------------

- Check docker:

```bash
docker info
```

- Check docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose --version
```
